      Bellydance, more correctly referred to as oriental dance, is an Arabic
      expressive dance that has its origins in Egypt since ancient times. It
      features movements of the hips and torso predominantly. It has evolved to
      take many different forms depending on the country and region, both in
      costume and dance style; with the Egyptian styles and costumes being the
      most recognized worldwide due to Egyptian cinema. The Egyptian style with
      its traditional Egyptian rythms is popular worldwide with many schools
      around the globe now practicing it.
